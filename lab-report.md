## Installing VScode
Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/ to download for Windows or whatever operating system you run on. After installing the package, open VScode and it should look like this:

## Remotely Connecting
After installing VScode, open the terminal by doing `` Ctrl + ` `` or going to the top and choosing `New Terminal` under `Terminal`. A terminal should pop up at the bottom.

Now we have to change the terminal from powershell to bash.
Follow the directions at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal/50527994#50527994
If you have bash active, your terminal should automatically start with `$`

From here, type `ssh cs15lwi23atl@ieng6.ucsd.edu` or replace the atl to your specific account. If this is your first time connecting, and it asks `Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?`, type `yes` and press enter.
Now enter your password and you will be logged into the remote server
